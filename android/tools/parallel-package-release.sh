# 1) you are in the main directory of the Anki source code (e.g. 'Anki-Android' is the current working directory)
# 2) you have a Java keystore, with a keystore+key password and key alias
# 3) you have no local changes in your working directory (e.g. "git reset --hard && git clean -f")
# If those assumptions are met, this script will generate 3 parallel builds that should be the same as your current checkout
# They will be placed in the parent directory ('..') as 'AnkiDroid-<version>.parallel.<A B or C>.apk'

# It takes 1 argument - the tag name to use for the build (e.g. '2.9alpha16')
# It will ask you for your keystore and key password
