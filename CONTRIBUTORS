If you have made changes to Anki's AGPL code, you are welcome to distribute
the changed code under the AGPL license.

If you would like to contribute your code back to the official release, we ask
that you license your contributions under the BSD 3 clause license. Portions
of the code are also used in AnkiWeb and AnkiMobile, and accepting
contributions under an AGPL license would mean we could no longer use the code
we have written in those projects.

In your first pull request, please add your name below. By adding your name to
this file, you assert that any code you contribute to the Anki project is
licensed under the BSD 3 clause license. If any pull request you make contains
code that you don't own the copyright to, you agree to make that clear when
submitting the request.

For users who previously confirmed the license of their contributions on the
support site, it would be great if you could add your name below as well.
