Please see the README file for basic requirements.

You also need to have the python-pyqt development packages installed
(specifically, you need the binary pyuic4). On Debian/Ubuntu this is

$ sudo apt-get install pyqt4-dev-tools

To use the development version:

$ git clone https://github.com/dae/anki.git
$ cd anki
$ ./tools/build_ui.sh

Make sure you rebuild the UI every time you update the sources.

The translations are stored in a bazaar repo for integration with Launchpad's
translation services. If you want to use a language other than English:

$ cd ..
$ mv anki dtop # i18n code expects anki folder to be called dtop
$ bzr clone lp:anki i18n
$ cd i18n
$ ./update-mos.sh
$ cd ../dtop

And now you're ready to run Anki:
$ ./runanki

If you get any errors, please make sure you don't have an older version of
Anki installed in a system location.
