- We use the fluent system+code generation for translation.
- New strings should be added to rslib/core/. Ask for the appropriate file if you're not sure.
- Assuming a string addons-you-have-count has been added to addons.ftl, that string is accessible in our different languages as follows:
  - Python: from aqt.utils import tr; msg = tr.addons_you_have_count(count=3)
  - TypeScript: import * as tr from "@generated/ftl"; tr.addonsYouHaveCount({count: 3})
  - Rust: collection.tr.addons_you_have_count(3)
- In Qt .ui files, strings that are marked as translatable will automatically use the registered ftl strings. So a QLabel with a title 'addons_you_have_count' that is marked as translatable will automatically use the translation defined in our addons.ftl file.
