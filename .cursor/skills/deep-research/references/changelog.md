# Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 2.4 | 2026-03-27 | Report compiler now consumes optional Style Profile (from academic-paper intake) and runs Writing Quality Check checklist before finalizing reports. Style Profile applied as soft guide for Executive Summary and Synthesis sections; discipline conventions take priority. Writing Quality Check catches overused AI-typical terms, em dash overuse, throat-clearing openers, and monotonous sentence rhythm.

Added monitoring_agent (post-pipeline literature monitoring with digests, retraction alerts, author tracking) + literature_monitoring_strategies reference.
