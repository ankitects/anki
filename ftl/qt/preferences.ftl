## Video drivers/hardware acceleration. Please avoid translating 'OpenGL' and 'ANGLE'.

preferences-video-driver = Video driver
preferences-video-driver-opengl-mac = OpenGL (recommended on Macs)
preferences-video-driver-software-mac = Software (not recommended)
preferences-video-driver-opengl-other = OpenGL (faster, may cause issues)
preferences-video-driver-software-other = Software (slower)
preferences-video-driver-angle = ANGLE (may work better than OpenGL)
