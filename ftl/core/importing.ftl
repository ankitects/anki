importing-merge-notetypes-help =
    If checked, and you or the deck author altered the schema of a notetype, Anki will

    Altering a notetype's schema means adding, removing, or reordering fields or templates,
    or changing the sort field.
    As a counterexample, changing the front side of an existing template does *not* constitute
    a schema change.
