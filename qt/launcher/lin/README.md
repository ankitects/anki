# Installing Anki

## Running directly

To run without installing, change to this folder in a terminal, and run the
following command:

./anki

## Installing

To install system wide, run 'sudo ./install.sh'

To remove in the future, run 'sudo /usr/local/share/anki/uninstall.sh'. You should
do this before installing a newer version.

## Audio

To play and record audio, mpv and lame must be installed. If mpv is not
installed or too old, Anki will try to fall back on using mplayer.

## Problems

If Anki fails to start, please run it from a terminal to see what errors it
outputs, and then post on our support site.
