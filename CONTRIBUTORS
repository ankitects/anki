If you have made changes to Anki's AGPL code, you are welcome to distribute
the changed code under the AGPL license.

If you would like to contribute your code back to the official release, we ask
that you license your contributions under the BSD 3 clause license. Portions
of the code are also used in AnkiWeb and AnkiMobile, and accepting
contributions under an AGPL license would mean we could no longer use the code
we have written in those projects.

In your first pull request, please add your name below. By adding your name to
this file, you assert that any code you contribute to the Anki project is
licensed under the BSD 3 clause license. If any pull request you make contains
code that you don't own the copyright to, you agree to make that clear when
submitting the request.

When submitting a pull request, GitHub Actions will check that the Git email you
are submitting from matches the one you used to edit this file. A common issue
is adding yourself to this file using the username on your computer, but then
using GitHub to rebase or edit a pull request online. This will result in your
Git email becoming something like user@noreply.github.com. To prevent the
automatic check from failing, you can edit this file again using GitHub's online
editor, making a trivial edit like adding a space after your name, and then pull
requests will work regardless of whether you create them using your computer or
GitHub's online interface.

For users who previously confirmed the license of their contributions on the
support site, it would be great if you could add your name below as well.
