# Anki Architecture

Very brief notes for now.

## Backend/GUI

At the highest level, Anki is logically separated into two parts.

A neat visualization of the file layout is available here:

(or go to <https://githubnext.com/projects/repo-visualization#explore-for-yourself> and enter `ankitects/anki`).

### Library (rslib & pylib)

The Python library (pylib) exports "backend" methods - opening collections,
fetching and answering cards, and so on. It is used by Ankiâ€™s GUI, and can also
be included in command line programs to access Anki decks without the GUI.

The library is accessible in Python with "import anki". Its code lives in
the `pylib/anki/` folder.

These days, the majority of backend logic lives in a Rust library (rslib, located in `rslib/`). Calls to pylib proxy requests to rslib, and return the results.

pylib contains a private Python module called rsbridge (`pylib/rsbridge/`) that wraps the Rust code, making it accessible in Python.

### GUI (aqt & ts)

Anki's _GUI_ is a mix of Qt (via the PyQt Python bindings for Qt), and
TypeScript/HTML/CSS. The Qt code lives in `qt/aqt/`, and is importable in Python
with "import aqt". The web code is split between `qt/aqt/data/web/` and `ts/`,
with the majority of new code being placed in the latter, and copied into the
former at build time.

## Protobuf

Anki uses Protocol Buffers to define backend methods, and the storage format of
some items in a collection file. The definitions live in `proto/anki/`.

The Python/Rust bridge uses them to pass data back and forth, and some of the
TypeScript code also makes use of them, allowing data to be communicated in a
type-safe manner between the different languages.

At the moment, the protobuf is not considered public API. Some pylib methods
expose a protobuf object directly to callers, but when they do so, they use a
type alias, so callers outside pylib should never need to import a generated
\_pb2.py file.
