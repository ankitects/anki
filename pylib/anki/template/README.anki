Anki uses a modified version of Pystache to provide Mustache-like syntax.
Behaviour is a little different from standard Mustache:

- {{text}} returns text verbatim with no HTML escaping
- {{{text}}} does the same and exists for backwards compatibility
- partial rendering is disabled for security reasons
- certain keywords like 'cloze' are treated specially
