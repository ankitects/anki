This repo contains the source code for the desktop version of
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net). 

## What is Anki?

Anki is a program that makes remembering things easy. Because it is a lot more efficient than traditional study methods, 
 you can either greatly decrease your time spent studying, or greatly increase the amount you learn. This is possible thanks to two simple concepts
 - Active Recall Testing: this means being asked a question and trying to remember the answer. Research has shown that this is very effective at building strong memories since the act of recalling something seems to increase the chances we'll be able to remember it again. Additionally, being unable to answer a question tells us to review the material to learn it again.
 - Use It or Lose It: our brain rapidly discards information it does not use, this is solved by Anki by letting you review content with spaced repetitions where some flashcards are shown to you repeatedly in time intervals that depend on how new, and hard the flashcard is.

For an in depth discussion of the concepts described above please check the [Anki Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/background.html).
